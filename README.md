# CSS-Bootstrap

This week's homework is about creating a responsive layout that can be viewed for computer and mobile users with using Bootstrap frameworks. 

<h2>Nav Bar</h2><br />
The nav bar is created by utilizing a code from getbootstrap. On the nav bar, there are three locations the user is able to navigate around. There will be “About Me”, “Portfolio” and “Contact.” Portfolio and Contact will direct to a new page. About Me will be located on the main page.


<h2>About Me</h2><br />
I used an image of a girl on a computer as the main photo. I was able to find a code from bootstrap that would allow text to wrap around the image. I used a lorem ipsum generator for text. 


<h2>Porfolio Page</h2><br />
I used a card title bootstrap for the porfolio page. I added images and a title underneath. 


<h2>Contact Page</h2><br />
I was able to find a form format in Bootstrap. With this form, there is a section for name, email and a message. A submit button was included as well.
