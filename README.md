# CSS-Bootstrap

This week's homework is about creating a responsive layout that can be viewed for computer and mobile users with using Bootstrap frameworks. 

The nav bar is created by utilizing a code from getbootstrap. On the nav bar, there are three locations the user is able to navigate around. There will be “About Me”, “Portfolio” and “Contact.” About Me is going to be on the main page. The link will direct the user exactly where the About Me header. Portfolio and Contact will redirect the user to another page. 













Contact Page
I was able to find a form format in Bootstrap. With this form, there is a section for name, email and a message. A submit button was included as well.
